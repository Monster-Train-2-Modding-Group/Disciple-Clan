# Disciple Clan – Design & Rebalance (MT2)

This document defines the clan’s design identity and rebalance goals for Monster Train 2. It builds on the port (see [README.md](README.md), [Champion.md](Champion.md), [MECHANICS.md](MECHANICS.md)) and guides tuning for MT2’s systems and power level.

## Thematic identity

The Disciple Clan is themed around **temporal and spatial manipulation**, rewarding the player for:

1. **Moving between floors** – Relocate, Gravity, Icarian (movement as cost and payoff).
2. **Making rooms matter** – Ward, Enchant, Symbiote, Pyre (filling and buffing rooms so placement is strategic).
3. **Managing timing** – Scrying, Ember, Reserve triggers (getting the right cards and resources when they matter).

## Why play Disciple?

**You play this clan if you want to:**

- **Take advantage of moving your units around** – Relocate triggers, Gravity, and movement tools (e.g. Pattern Shift, Bump) make repositioning a core decision; moving units is both rewarded and sometimes constrained.
- **Make rooms special and strategic** – Wards and room modifiers (Symbiote, Vigor, Spike, Haruspex, Overward) make each floor a distinct “enchantment”; moving in or out is costly and can be very beneficial.
- **Get the cards you need on time / use time to your advantage** – Scrying, prophecy-style draw, Ember/Emberboost, and Reserve-style triggers emphasize hand quality and turn timing rather than raw stat stacking.

## Design pillars and mechanics

| Pillar | Mechanics | Intent |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Movement (spatial)** | Relocate trigger, Gravity, Icarian, Pattern Shift, Bump/ascend/descend | Movement is a lever: enable it (Relocate payoffs), restrict it (Gravity), or risk it (Icarian). |
| **Rooms (enchant / ward)** | Wards (Spike, Vigor, Haruspex, Overward), Symbiote, Pyreboost, room modifiers | Rooms are “enchanted” so placement and capacity matter; wards add persistent or triggered effects per floor. |
| **Timing (temporal)** | Scrying / prophecy draw, Ember / Emberboost, Reserve triggers, Rewind, cost manipulation | Card flow and resource timing matter; the clan favors setup and sequencing over pure face damage. |

Rebalance for MT2 should keep these three pillars readable and impactful without letting any one dominate (e.g. Relocate shouldn’t make placement trivial; room effects shouldn’t make movement irrelevant).

## Rebalance principles (MT2)

1. **Clarity** – Each path and keyword (Relocate, Ward, Symbiote, Pyreboost, etc.) should have a one-line player-facing meaning.
2. **Tradeoffs** – Movement and room commitment should have visible costs (e.g. Gravity, ward limits, ember cost) so decisions feel meaningful.
3. **MT2 parity** – Tune numbers and triggers against MT2’s difficulty and vanilla clans; avoid MT1-era one-shots or “must-pick” single cards.
4. **Port fidelity vs. fun** – Where MT1 behavior is awkward or weak in MT2, prefer small mechanical tweaks over strict 1:1 port (document in Champion.md / MECHANICS.md).
